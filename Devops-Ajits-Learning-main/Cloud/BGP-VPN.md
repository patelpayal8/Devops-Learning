When running BGP over a VPN (e.g., IPsec tunnel), you can encounter many similar issues as eBGP/iBGP‚Äîbut layered atop VPN-specific networking challenges. Here's a summary of the most common problems and their solutions:

---

## üß© 1. Tunnel Down or Flapping

**Issue:** BGP can‚Äôt establish or keeps resetting if the underlying VPN (IKE/IPsec) goes down or is unstable. AWS re\:Post highlights this as a primary cause of BGP session failures ([repost.aws][1]).

**Solution:** Monitor IKE (phase 1) and IPsec (phase 2) negotiations. Ensure stable tunnel lifetimes, verify phase settings, and enable auto-retries or path monitoring. Optionally, run BGP over loopback with static routes to keep the session up even during flaps .

---

## üîå 2. BGP Session Not Establishing

**Issue:** Even with an active tunnel, BGP TCP port 179 or VPN selectors might be misconfigured. Cisco forum documentation and FortiGate bug reports point to missing phase-2 selectors blocking BGP traffic .

**Solution:**

* Confirm TCP 179 is allowed through the IPsec policy.
* Ensure both local and remote BGP peer IPs are included in the tunnel's selectors/security domains.
* On loopback-based BGP, create static routes toward the peer via the tunnel interface ([reddit.com][2]).

---

## üîÅ 3. Tunnel Redundancy & Failover Issues

**Issue:** In dual‚Äëtunnel (active/passive or active/active) setups, BGP often sticks to one tunnel, and session doesn‚Äôt failover smoothly. FortiGate users note the session stays on the "primary" even after failover .

**Solution:**

* Use BGP peering from a loopback address with correct source selection during flaps.
* Enable `bgp link-down-failover` or similar, to force re-advertisement upon tunnel change ([community.fortinet.com][3]).
* For active/active setups, configure ECMP or BGP multipath to balance flows and handle return traffic correctly ([reddit.com][4]).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Route Cycling & Asymmetric Forwarding

**Issue:** BGP may advertise routes learned over the tunnel causing tunnel endpoint substitution‚Äîleading to traffic looping or tunnel flapping (a classic chicken‚Äëegg) .

**Solution:**

* Filter route advertisements: don‚Äôt advertise your tunnel endpoint/subnet into BGP.
* Use prefix‚Äëlists to control which routes are advertised over the VPN ([reddit.com][5], [repost.aws][1]).

---

## üÜî 5. VRF/Segmentation Misalignment

**Issue:** On multi‚ÄëVRF systems, if the IPSec tunnel and BGP run in different VRFs, BGP may establish but not exchange any routes .

**Solution:**

* Place both the tunnel interface and BGP neighbor in the same VRF, or implement route‚Äëleaking.
* Ensure you set the correct `update-source` on the peer to match the VPN interface‚Äôs VRF context ([reddit.com][6]).

## üóìÔ∏è 6. BGP Flapping / Hold Timer Expiry

**Issue:** BGP flaps‚Äîoften triggered by intermittent VPN issues‚Äîlead to repeated session resets. A Juniper SRX example showed BGP keepalives not making it due to MTU/segmentation issues over IPsec . Also, some firmware releases (e.g. FortiGate v7.2.9) introduced regular flaps every \~25 minutes ([reddit.com][7]).

**Solution:**

* Adjust MTU/MSS on tunnel to accommodate encapsulation overhead.
* Confirm keepalive/hold timers match at both ends.
* Upgrade firmware to avoid known bugs.
* Monitor logs for ‚ÄúHold Timer Expired‚Äù and apply fixes accordingly ([reddit.com][7], [juniper.net][8]).

### üéØ Best Practices

1. **Terminate BGP on loopback**, not tunnel IP.
2. **Use static route** to peer via tunnel.
3. **Include peer IPs in IPsec selectors**.
4. **Filter out** tunnel endpoint/address subnets to avoid routing loops.
5. **Enable BGP multipath/ECMP** for redundancy.
6. **Match timers and MTU/MSS** at both ends.
7. **Keep firmware updated** and monitor logs for keepalive failures.
