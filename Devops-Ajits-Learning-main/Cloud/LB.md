Global Accelerator + ALB/NLB per Region
ðŸ§  What It Does:

    Global Accelerator gives users a static IP entry point that routes traffic to the closest healthy AWS region.

    Built on AWS global backbone â€“ faster than standard internet.

    It works with ALB or NLB in multiple regions.

ðŸ“¦ Use Case:

You want one global IP for your app, and AWS should automatically route traffic to the nearest or healthy ALB (e.g., Singapore or Tokyo).
ðŸ”§ Key Features:

    Improves latency and failover.

    Ideal for global users.

    Acts like a region-aware, health-checking router on AWS edge locations.
