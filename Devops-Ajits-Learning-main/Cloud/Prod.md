---

## üîß **Deployment Plan:**

### üóÇÔ∏è Phase 1: Planning & Design

Ajit works with the client‚Äôs CISO and DevOps teams to:

* Define **VCN/Subnet structure** for both regions.
* Design **Palo Alto Active‚ÄìPassive HA pairs** in **AD1 and AD2**.
* Map **PCI DSS requirements** to OCI components (WAF, Vault, Logging).
* Prepare **Terraform blueprints** for IaC-based repeatable deployments.

### üìÅ Phase 2: Infrastructure Deployment (per Region)

Ajit deploys the following via Terraform:

| Component                           | Notes                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VCN + Subnets**                   | Public, DMZ, App, DB, Management (across AD1/AD2)        |
| **OCI WAF**                         | With OWASP rules and geo restrictions                    |
| **Public Load Balancer**            | HTTPS listener, backend = Palo Alto HA                   |
| **Palo Alto Firewalls (VM-Series)** | HA config via bootstrap ISO, AD1 = Active, AD2 = Passive |
| **Internal Load Balancer**          | Distributes traffic to backend app VMs                   |
| **App Instances**                   | OCI Compute with OCI Security Agent + AV                 |
| **DB Tier**                         | Autonomous DB with private endpoint & encryption enabled |
| **Object Storage**                  | For logs, backups, and image bootstraps                  |

### üîÑ Phase 3: High Availability & Failover

Ajit configures:

* OCI Traffic Management (Geo Proximity Routing) between Mumbai & Hyderabad
* HA links between Palo Alto nodes using **unicast heartbeat**
* OCI Health Checks for LBs and failover triggers
* Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) for east-west and outbound NAT via firewall

### üîê Phase 4: Compliance & Hardening

Ajit applies:

| Control Area                    | Action                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encryption**                  | All volumes encrypted with KMS (OCI Vault)                                 |
| **No Public IP**                | Enforced on App/DB tiers via subnet policy                                 |
| **IAM Policy**                  | Fine-grained roles for OCI users via Groups                                |
| **OCI Security Zones**          | To enforce no-public-IP, encryption, logging                               |
| **Palo Alto Security Policies** | Block unused ports, URL filtering, threat prevention enabled               |
| **Logging**                     | Integrated OCI Logs + Palo Alto logs ‚Üí SIEM via syslog                     |
| **Monitoring**                  | Configured OCI Monitoring alarms + Cloud Guard + OCI Vulnerability Scanner |
