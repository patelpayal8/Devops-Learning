 # CloudWatch, Auto Scaling, Elastic Recovery

ðŸ§  What It Does:

ðŸ”¸ CloudWatch

    Monitors CPU, memory, network, disk, logs.

    Set alarms on thresholds (e.g., CPU > 80%).

ðŸ”¸ Auto Scaling

    Dynamically adds/removes EC2 instances based on load.

    Helps handle traffic spikes or failures.

ðŸ”¸ Elastic Recovery

    Automatically recovers EC2 from hardware failures.

    You can configure auto-reboot or replacement.

ðŸ“¦ Use Case:

    EC2 instance CPU > 80% â†’ Auto Scaling adds more instances.

    EC2 instance fails â†’ AWS Elastic Recovery replaces or restarts the instance.

    CloudWatch monitors logs and triggers alerts to Slack/SNS/email. Jira ticket can be created for manual intervention if needed.
