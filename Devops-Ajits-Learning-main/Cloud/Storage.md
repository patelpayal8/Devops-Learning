# 1. OBJECT STORAGE - Both offer durable (11 9s), highly available storage. OCI is cost-optimized, while AWS S3 has a richer ecosystem.

| Feature                  | **AWS S3**                                                | **OCI Object Storage**                     |

# 2. BLOCK STORAGE - Both provide scalable, encrypted block storage. OCI offers dynamic performance tuning without detaching the disk, unlike AWS.

| Feature             | **AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store)**                  | **OCI Block Volumes**                                |

| Performance Scaling | ‚úÖ Based on IOPS, throughput tier                   | ‚úÖ Dynamic performance tuning                         |
| Multi-attach        | ‚úÖ io1/io2 volumes (multi-AZ supported)             | ‚úÖ Multi-attach supported                             |

# 3. FILE STORAGE - EFS is more elastic, while OCI‚Äôs File Storage is high-throughput and more manual in scaling, suited for enterprise NFS needs.

| Feature            | **AWS EFS / FSx**                               | **OCI File Storage Service**           |

| Protocol Support   | NFS (EFS), SMB (FSx for Windows)                | NFS v3/v4 only                         |
| Scalability        | EFS: scales automatically                       | Manual scaling / quota increase needed |
| Throughput Modes   | General Purpose, Max I/O (EFS)                  | Performance tiers (Standard, Higher)   |
| Multi-AZ/AD Access | ‚úÖ Yes (EFS is regional)                         | ‚úÖ Yes (across ADs in region)           |
| Encryption         | ‚úÖ Yes (at rest & in transit)                    | ‚úÖ Yes                                  |
| Mount Targets      | Region-level endpoints (EFS), VPC mount targets | Mount targets per subnet               |

# 4. ARCHIVE STORAGE - Both are cold storage, but OCI Archive Storage is often cheaper and integrates directly with standard object APIs.

| Feature          | **AWS Glacier / Glacier Deep Archive**            | **OCI Archive Storage**                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Use Case         | Long-term, infrequently accessed backups and data | Same                                             |

| Cost             | Lowest AWS storage cost                           | Extremely low ‚Äì cheaper than AWS in many regions |
| Write / Read API | S3 API                                            | Object Storage API                               |
| Use in Lifecycle | S3 lifecycle policies to move to Glacier          | OCI lifecycle rules to archive tier              |
