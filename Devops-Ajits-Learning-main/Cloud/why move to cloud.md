### üß† **Real-World Use Case**

> A retail company with 5 branches used to run POS systems and inventory on-prem. Scaling during Diwali took months. After migrating to AWS:
>
> * Used **Auto Scaling**, **CloudFront CDN**, and **Aurora Serverless**
> * Cut infra cost by 30%, improved uptime to 99.99%
> * Reduced deployment time from weeks to **minutes**

---

### üö´ **When Not to Move to Cloud**

> Cloud is not always the best fit. Consider staying on-prem if:

* You need **ultra-low latency** for real-time apps (e.g., HFT) High Frequency Tranding.
* **Data residency laws** restrict public cloud usage
* Existing hardware investments are too recent to abandon

### üìä Decision Table

| Feature           | On-Prem                | Cloud                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Upfront Cost      | High CapEx             | Low (Pay-as-you-go)         |

| Innovation Speed  | Slow                   | Fast (use of PaaS, AI, etc) |




### ‚úÖ **Top Reasons to Move from On-Prem to Cloud**

#### 1. **Scalability**

* **On-Prem:** Scaling requires purchasing and provisioning physical hardware.
* **Cloud:** Instantly scale up/down resources (CPU, RAM, storage, bandwidth) based on demand.

  * Example: Auto-scaling web servers during high traffic events.

#### 2. **Cost Optimization (CapEx ‚Üí OpEx)**

* **On-Prem:** Capital-intensive ‚Äî buy hardware, data center space, power, cooling, staff.
* **Cloud:** Pay-as-you-go or reserved models; no hardware investment.

  * Example: Shut down dev/test environments after hours to save cost.

#### 3. **High Availability & Disaster Recovery**

* **On-Prem:** Expensive and complex to design multi-site DR.
* **Cloud:** Built-in redundancy across **regions** and **availability zones**.

  * Example: AWS Multi-AZ RDS provides auto-failover for databases.

#### 4. **Faster Time to Market**

* **On-Prem:** Weeks/months to provision infrastructure.
* **Cloud:** Deploy VMs, containers, and services in minutes.

  * Example: Launch a global app using CDN + cloud functions in a day.

#### 5. **Global Reach & Edge Presence**

* **On-Prem:** Limited to your data center‚Äôs location.
* **Cloud:** Deploy resources close to your users (low latency).

  * Example: Use OCI or AWS WAF + CDN at multiple edge locations.

#### 6. **Security & Compliance**

* **Cloud:** Leading providers (AWS, Azure, OCI, GCP) offer:

  * Data encryption at rest and in transit
  * Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  * Compliance certifications: PCI-DSS, HIPAA, ISO, etc.
* **You can build a zero-trust model with security at every layer.**

#### 7. **DevOps & Automation**

* **Cloud-native tools** allow:

  * CI/CD (Jenkins, CodePipeline)
  * IaC (Terraform, CloudFormation)
  * Monitoring (Prometheus, CloudWatch)
* Rapid testing, feedback, and delivery pipelines.

#### 8. **Innovation with Managed Services**

* On-prem requires managing databases, queues, AI/ML tools, etc.
* In cloud:

  * Use **SaaS** and **PaaS** like managed DB (RDS), serverless (Lambda, OCI Functions), AI/ML services.
  * Reduce maintenance burden.

üîç Key Characteristics of HFT:

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed-sensitive**    | Microseconds or nanoseconds matter.                                         |
| **Low-latency**        | Requires **ultra-fast network**, usually colocated next to stock exchanges. |
| **Algorithmic**        | Uses bots/algorithms to make trading decisions.                             |
| **High volume**        | Makes thousands of trades per second.                                       |
| **Short holding time** | Often holds assets for milliseconds to seconds.                             |

| Cloud Limitation            | Impact on HFT                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network latency**         | Cloud cannot match the **sub-millisecond** latency of on-prem colo near exchanges. |
| **No colocation proximity** | HFT firms colocate servers physically inside or next to exchange buildings.        |
| **Shared infra**            | Public cloud = shared environment; adds unpredictable delays.                      |
| **Regulatory barriers**     | Sensitive financial workloads may face compliance issues in cloud.                 |

‚úÖ Where HFT Runs Instead:

    Colocation Facilities (Colo):

        Rack servers inside stock exchanges (e.g., NYSE, BSE, NSE).
        Access to market data and order books with microsecond latency.

    On-Premises Data Centers:

        With dedicated fiber and custom-built networking optimized for speed.


üí° Fun Fact:
    A 1-millisecond advantage in trading can be worth millions of dollars per year. That's why HFT firms invest in custom hardware, FPGAs, and dedicated fiber optics.
