üéØ Summary

    IKEv1: multi-step, distinct phases (6 + 3 messages) ‚Äî traditional but more verbose.
    IKEv2: streamlined into two compact exchanges (‚â•4 messages), combining SA negotiation and authentication.


# MOBIKE:

MOBIKE (**M**obility and **Mult**ihoming **IKE**) is a standardized IKEv2 extension (defined in **RFC‚ÄØ4555**) that enables IPsec VPN tunnels to remain active, even if the client‚Äôs IP address changes or it switches between networks/interfaces. ([rfc-editor.org][1])

---

## üîë Why MOBIKE Matters

* **Mobility**: If you're using a VPN on your laptop or mobile device and move between Wi‚ÄëFi networks or switch from Wi‚ÄëFi to mobile data, the public IP can change. Without MOBIKE, the VPN session would break. With MOBIKE, the IKE/IPsec tunnel adapts seamlessly.&#x20;
* **Multihoming**: For devices with multiple network paths (e.g., wired‚ÄØ+‚ÄØcellular), MOBIKE allows selecting the best interface without tearing down the VPN.&#x20;

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How MOBIKE Works

1. **Negotiation**

   * During IKEv2‚Äôs IKE\_AUTH exchange, peers indicate support using the `MOBIKE_SUPPORTED` notification. ([cisco.com][2])
2. **Detecting Change**

   * The client/watchdog monitors IP/interface changes (e.g., new IP, gateway unreachable). ([en.wikipedia.org][3])
3. **Updating Peer**

   * An `UPDATE_SA_ADDRESS` informational message is sent via IKEv2 to update the source (and optionally destination) IP for both the IKE SA and child IPsec SAs. ([datatracker.ietf.org][4])
4. **Return‚ÄëRoutability Check (Optional)**

   * Some implementations (e.g., Cisco) use cookie‚Äëchallenge to verify the peer can use the new address before switching it. ([cisco.com][2])

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Real-World Benefits

* Mobile VPN clients like **strongSwan** and **WatchGuard Firebox** support MOBIKE, allowing seamless roaming across networks without re-authentication. ([docs.strongswan.org][5])
* Infrastructure like Cisco‚Äôs **ASR series** supports MOBIKE to handle dynamic client IP changes in mobile/untrusted environments. ([rfc-editor.org][6])

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

* **What it is**: An IKEv2 extension enabling dynamic IP updates without rekeying.
* **Key capabilities**: Mobility (client IP changes) and multihoming (interface selection).
* **Mechanism**: Controlled via `MOBIKE_SUPPORTED` and `UPDATE_SA_ADDRESS` messages, optionally with validation.
* **Result**: VPN sessions stay up even when networks/interfaces change ‚Äî ideal for mobile users.
