# Devops-Ajits-Learning

There was a time when writing Python code for basic tasks felt pointless to me, like something you do in college just to pass exams.

But things changed when I started learning DevOps with Abhishek Veeramalla. That’s when I realized how powerful Python can be, especially when working with cloud platforms and automating real-world tasks. It finally started to make sense.

I had gone through a few Python courses before, but they never really clicked. With Abhishek’s practical, hands-on style, I started to enjoy it — and more importantly, understand it as he integrated Python training with DevOps mindset and use-cases.

To be honest, I used to think AI might replace developers one day. But in my case, AI feels more like a Brother, a friend, a coding buddy — who takes my hand and guides me, especially when I’m stuck or frustrated with debugging. Tools like IntelliSense and AI in VSCode have made learning smoother and much less intimidating. 

* It's always best to utilize AI when you feel now more time is wasted behind debugging.

Now, I’m genuinely excited about skilling up. Over the next few months, my goal is to start writing automation scripts — maybe not super complex right away, but definitely practical. And with time, I’ll get better and more confident.
